# Windows Scripts
I created these scripts in an effort to import all my Google Apps users information in Active Directory. I then took that information, and had a script that updated everyone's Outlook signatures on boot. I have comments on the import script, for the signature script just fill in the necessary information for your domain and servers. Then put the docx in your SYSVOL folder so everyone can access with it Read and Execute only. Then it's up to you on how you want to run the script.

Hope this helps!
